# CP1_25 (Advanced C Programming Course Repository)

COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 1 course for BCSAI program:  

Welcome to the repository for **Advanced C Programming** – your central hub for all course materials, exercises, assignments, and projects.

## Course Overview

This course strengthens students’ C programming skills, introducing advanced memory management, multi-threading, and networking concepts. You will build high-performance, networked C applications and explore systems programming, embedded development, and AI-based optimizations.

We take a deep dive through modern C programming, focusing on best practices, helpful tools, and full programming techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to help you easily find all resources related to each module and session:

- **modules/**
  - **module-1/**
    - **session-1/**
    - **session-2/**
    - ...
  - **module-2/**
    - **session-5/**
    - **session-6/**
    - ...
  - ...

Each **module** covers a major topic of the course (e.g., Memory Management, Multithreading, Networking,..).  
Each **session** folder contains the relevant exercises, assignments, code samples, and project instructions for that particular session.

**Check the course schedule:**  
   You will gain access to each session’s folder before the class session begins.

## Best Practices

This course emphasizes:

- Writing clean, maintainable C code
- Modular programming and clear abstractions
- Explicit and safe memory management
- Thread-safe and concurrent programming
- Secure networking with C APIs
- Documentation and effective version control
